Google Fonts is a library of 1513 open source font families and APIs for
convenient use via CSS and Android. The library also has delightful and
beautifully crafted icons for common actions and items. Download them for
use in your digital products for Android, iOS, and web.

<p>
Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to
explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We
showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics
on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you
discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes
 fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can
also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families,
weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy.
Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and
ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and
engineering process. In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog,
expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the
Material icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common
communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital
products for Android, iOS, and web.
